Improvements from part 2 to Final Poe 
With regard to my final POE i mainly focused on index.tsx (homepage) and two.tsx (filter page)
for index.tsx my improvements were:
Addition of React import
Simplification of Type Definitions: Instead of Dish[] | null, directly using Dish[] to indicate the array will always be an empty array or contain dishes. This simplifies the type checking and reduces unnecessary complexity.
Simplified Logic: The condition for course === '' has been simplified. The ternary operator makes the code more concise without changing its behavior. This reduces repetition and improves readability.
Better Styling: The description and price text now have dedicated styles (e.g. styles.dishDescription, styles.dishPrice). This provides clearer intent for styling, ensuring consistency and easier customization.
UI Enhancements: Improved styling with more consistent and modern UI components.
I also changed the layout of my homepage making it simpler and making the quantity selector functional.

For two.tsx my improvements were:
Highly interactive: Allows the user to click on a dish to update its quantity.
Includes state management with useState to track dish quantities and the total price.
Displays images of dishes with descriptions and dynamically updates quantities and prices.
A dynamic layout using ScrollView to handle multiple dishes and ensure scrolling.
The design is more modern and refined with a card-style layout for each dish.
The background is #fef5e7, and the dishes have a white background with a drop shadow to create depth.
The layout is designed for better UX, with clear distinctions between image, text, and pricing.
The menu data is stored in an array of dishes, each with a name, description, price, and image. This allows for easy updates or changes to the menu.
The use of a map function (dishes.map) allows for dynamic rendering of menu items, making the code more modular and scalable.
